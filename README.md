# Forum Frontend (Day2-YL-4)

1. Navbar always visible on every page.
2. Buttons adapt based on user group:
    - visitor / unverified / normal / admin / super_admin
3. Current route button can be hidden (optional UX improvement).
4. Added logout button that clears token + redux state.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
